Code attributed to members of the team.
---------------------------------------

Valliyil Saikiran:

- Worked and developed the Semaphores (The most challenging part for us)
- integreated all other existing methods developed by team members to work with semaphore module created.
- Created semaphore queues and status_list queue to be used by all queues implemented
- Ensured the output of the textfile(test_file_C)matched the sample textfile that was provided.
- Cameup with most of the project implementation idea.

Singh Swati:

- Worked on the implementation of the I/O 
- Ensured the I/O process worked as it should be.
- created the I/O wait queue for processes that encountered interrupts
- Ensured I/O module worked perfectly with existing codes written by team members
- Encouraged the team to keep working when we got stuck by proferring other ideas and solutions.
- created team pie chart

Tinubu Helix:

- Worked on the first part of simulation of the project (processes) excluding the I/O and Semaphores.
- Ensured the project worked well with the reading in of procces from textfile, populating the job scheduling queue with processes.
- integreated all other methods developed by my team members together with initial code.
- formatted output and Calculated average timings for the operations.
- Created the readme file

It took the team over a week to finish the project. Each individual had to work separately and constantly trying to merge
each portion of the code to the existing snippets available so as to be sure it works correctly with other parts.
